### Introduction

ACNet is a model combine **traditional machine learning model** with causal inference model using  **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning** , and is used to predict and causal-inference,  such as land-atmosphere feedback. This research is inspired by paper "[Causal discovery with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04477)" in AAAI 2020.

This project contain two parts. 
1. Construct a process based on  Machine Learning methods to predict Soil Moisture, and analysis the results.
2. Construct a model based on causal-inference model and machine learning model to predict soil moisture and identify target complex relationship between moisture to meteorology.
