that fulfil requirements of `MetReg` (refer to docs/requirements.pdf). And 
generating json file of datasets, images of basic information (e.g., entropy,
average, seasonal trending, etc) and images of causality relationship between
inputs variables by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

1. data analysis

2. normalization

4. outliers preprocessing

5. static features generator

6. deeper features generator

7. json saving

8. DAG

9. feature selection
